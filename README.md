Primes Generator
----------------

**Asymptotic Analysis**
> This represents the mathematical time complexity of the primes_generator algorithm. The solution has a time complexity 
> of O(N^2). This is because the ``for loop`` runs through the values generated by the range function only once which is O(N) 
> and in the worst case, the nested ``while loop`` will have to loop until the termination condition is met if its ``break`` 
> statement is never executed which is another O(N). Since each loop has O(N) time complexity, this results in O(N^2)
